### Exploring The Throughput of Observatories
The throughput of an observatory is determined by various components:
- Atmosphere extinction (for ground-based observatory)
- Optics (mostly mirrors)
- Transparency of the broad band filter
- The photon loss associated with the AR coating of the filter
- Quantum efficiency of the detector
